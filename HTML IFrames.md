### HTML IFrame
- HTML Iframe is used to display a nested webpage (a webpage within a webpage). 
- The HTML `<iframe>` tag defines an inline frame, hence it is also called as an **Inline Frame**.
- An HTML iframe embeds another document within the current HTML document in the rectangular region. 
- The webpage content and iframe contents can interact with each other using JavaScript.

`<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" height="200" width="300" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>`

#### Targeting a iframe by an Anchor link
```
<div>
	<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" name="iframe_a" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>    
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="iframe_a">W3Schools.com</a>
	</p>
</div>
```


#### Project suggestion - 
- **makes a common webpages with small Iframes of webpages of other projects as a carousel, just as a trophy page in your portfolio page.**
